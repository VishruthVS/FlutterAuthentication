# Flutter Firebase Authentication

This Flutter project demonstrates how to implement user authentication using Firebase. Firebase offers a powerful and secure way to manage user authentication in your Flutter apps. In this project, we'll walk you through the steps to set up Firebase Authentication, along with a basic Flutter app that allows users to sign up, sign in, and sign out.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Flutter
- Firebase Account

## Getting Started

1.Clone the repository
git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-firebase-authentication.git>

2.Navigate to the project folder
cd flutter-firebase-authentication

3.Install dependencies
flutter pub get

4.Create a Firebase project

- Visit the Firebase Console.
- Click on "Add project" or select an existing project.

5.Set up your app in Firebase

- Add an app to your project by clicking on the Android or iOS icon (whichever is applicable).
- Follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with Firebase.

6.Add Firebase configuration files

- Download the google-services.json file (for Android) or GoogleService-Info.plist file (for iOS) from the Firebase Console.
- Place these files in the respective platform directories (android/app and ios/Runner).

7.Configure Firebase Authentication

- In the Firebase Console, go to "Authentication" and enable the desired sign-in methods (e.g., Email/Password, Google, etc.).

8.Update Firebase configuration in your Flutter app

- Open the lib/config/firebase_config.dart file.
- Replace the apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, and messagingSenderId with your Firebase project configuration.

9.Run the app

flutter run

10.Sign up and Sign in

- Open the app and create a new account or sign in using your email and password.

11.Sign out

- You can sign out by clicking the "Sign Out" button.

## Folder Structure
